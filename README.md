### FluidityKit

> still work in progress

This Swift Package contains the base code used in the Fluidity serial port tool (not yet published), including serial port (and its related USB controller) discovery, communication between host and the target devices, etc.

The APIs of FluidityKit are subject to __change at any time__, potentially introducing __breaking changes__ during early development. It is strongly advised _not to use_ this package in production environments.
